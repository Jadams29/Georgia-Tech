# Computational Photography Lab Exercises

This repository contains *ungraded* lab exercises for Computational Photography.  These projects are not submitted, but the topics may appear on the final exam.


## Notebooks

### [Image Processing & Analysis](/1-image_processing)

Introduce key parts of the numpy and OpenCV APIs with an emphasis on applications in computational photography.


### [Image Frequency Spectra](/2-frequency_spectra)

Explore image processing in the frequency domain.


### [Features, Keypoints, & Applications](/3-features_keypoints)

Implement image keypoint descriptors and experiment with [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM), a powerful open source tool for computing [structure from motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion).


## Setup

You can use the same conda environment for the lab notebooks that is used for the graded assignments. Refer to the instructions in the assignments repository to setup your environment.

With the `CS6475` environment active, you can run the notebook by executing `jupyter notebook` from your terminal. The terminal will display a URL that you can copy to reach the notebook explorer which can be used to select a notebook file (i.e., a file ending in ".ipynb"). Once the notebook launches, make sure to use the "kernel" menu to select the `CS6475` environment.

You can edit code in any cell of the notebook, and execute each cell by clicking the "play" icon on the menu bar, or using the "shift + enter" keyboard shortcut. The output of each cell will appear inline in the notebook immediately after each cell.
