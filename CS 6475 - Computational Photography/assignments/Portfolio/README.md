# Coursework Portfolio

**Important Notes:** There will be no 2 late day option and there will be no regrade requests for the final portfolio, unless you see some drastic mistake we made in your grade. This assignment is NOT subject to the "Above & Beyond" rule. It will be graded out of 100 points. 

## Synopsis

The goal of this assignment is to showcase all the work you have done in this class in one final course portfolio.  You will create a google doc presentation of your class assignments, midterm project, and final project.  You may share the portfolio with your friends and family so that they can see what kept you busy this term.


## Instructions

### 1. Complete the portfolio by compiling your results from the term in the template file.

Make a copy of the [report template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bP-mMbsWhVlibPs0NAvmWhKeWQH4BjSwjfCcpoa-uUg/edit?usp=sharing) and update it with your information from all 7 Assignments, your Midterm Project, and your Final Term Project.  If you were unable to complete any of the assignments/projects this semester, still fill out a slide that at least states the purpose of the assignment/project and mention what you were unable to complete. Do NOT skip over the assignment/project. Your portfolio should have at least 1 slide for each of the 7 assignments, Midterm, and Final project. 

You are not limited to one slide per assignment. Feel free to add more slides and show new results if you want to. Be creative and reasonably detailed - make sure the purpose of each assignment and project is clear. If you were to show your portfolio to anyone outside this class, would they understand what you were trying to accomplish? You do NOT need to write long answers; be brief and summarize. Portfolios that include 1) your results from every assignment 2) are neat and well organized  3) clearly identify each assignmentâ€™s purpose and 4) mention your experience or reactions, generally receive full scores. If you follow the instructions and give full effort, you should be fine.

**Note:** Make sure that ALL links you include in your portfolio are viewable by anyone with the link.  We cannot grade what we do not see.  Test your links from another computer, or have someone else test them from your portfolio before you submit.

### 2. Submit the Portfolio

Save your portfolio as `portfolio.pdf` and submit it in a zip archive on Canvas. The name of the zip file is not important.

**Note:** The total size of your portfolio must be less than 8MB for this project. If your submission is too large, you can reduce the scale of your images or portfolio. You can compress your portfolio using [Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf).
