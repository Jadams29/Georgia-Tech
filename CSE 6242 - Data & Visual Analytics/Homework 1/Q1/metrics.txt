The average node degree is the average number of edges connected to each node. So, this is the average number of similar movies to a movie. 
The graph diameter is the longest shortest path between any two nodes. For our example this describes how the overall data correlates. The longer the shortest path the less similar the data is. 
The average shortest path length is taken by finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes and averaging over the length of the paths. This shows on average how similar all of our movies are.
