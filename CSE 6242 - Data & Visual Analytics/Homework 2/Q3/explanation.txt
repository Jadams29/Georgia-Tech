Q3.a.2)	
	Budget vs Rating is better at separating the two classes.
	Both classes are more spread out which allows the two classes to be distinguished better.
	When you compare the two graphs, the first one seems to condense the data rather than separate.
	The reason is the y axis.
	
Q3.c)
	The log and Sqrt scales are used to express different types of data.
	Log would be best used when the data is exponential such as growth rates of bacteria.
	Using a square root scale can allow for the data to closer align with expected results.
